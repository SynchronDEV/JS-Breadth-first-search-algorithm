# JS Breadth-first search algorithm 
This is the BFS Algorithm I wrote using Vanilla JS as a part of a technical interview at Klarna in 2019

The goal of the task to find the shortest path given an input of 2 arrays and 2 numbers (start and end), and to then return the length of the shortest path. The algorithm passed all tests and helped me onto the next step in the interview process.
